    <h3 class="section-header">Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p class="intro-content">
      At Jizo Noods, we value your privacy and strive to make our practices as
      transparent as possible. This privacy policy outlines the technologies we
      use on our website, the reasons behind their use, and the type of data
      collected. We want you to feel safe and informed while browsing our site.
    </p>
    <h5 class="section-subheader">Technologies Used</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bootstrap (via CDN): We use Bootstrap to style our website and provide
        you with a consistent and responsive experience. This is hosted
        externally via a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
      </li>
      <li>
        FontAwesome (via CDN): FontAwesome icons are used to visually enhance
        our site and make navigation easier. These icons are also hosted
        externally via a CDN.
      </li>
      <li>
        Google Fonts (locally embedded): We use Google Fonts, which are
        downloaded and embedded locally on our server. This helps in reducing
        data transmission to third-party servers and ensures better privacy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hosting (Netlify): Our website is hosted via Netlify, a secure and
        reliable hosting service, which also helps improve website performance.
        The hosting is encrypted with a certificate to ensure secure data
        transmission.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h5 class="section-subheader">Why We Use These Technologies</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bootstrap and FontAwesome: To provide a visually appealing,
        user-friendly, and consistent design across devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Google Fonts: To ensure that the website has a unique and consistent
        appearance, without relying on external servers for fonts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Netlify Hosting: To ensure our website remains fast, secure, and
        accessible.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="section-subheader">Data Collection and Sharing</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Technical Data: When you visit our website, some technical data is
        automatically collected, such as your IP address, browser type, and
        device information. This data is collected solely to ensure our website
        functions properly and is optimized for all users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third-Party CDNs: When using technologies like Bootstrap and FontAwesome
        through CDNs, there may be minimal data transferred to third-party
        servers (e.g., your IP address). We use these CDNs to ensure fast
        loading times for our visitors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Personal Data: We do not collect any personal data such as names, email
        addresses, or other identifying information from visitors, nor do we
        store such data on our servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        No Analytics: We do not use any data analysis or tracking tools on our
        website. Our goal is to provide a secure and privacy-focused experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="section-subheader">Your Privacy Matters</h5>
    <p>
      We are committed to minimizing any data shared with third parties. By
      using locally embedded Google Fonts and avoiding unnecessary tracking
      tools, we aim to give you the most private and safe browsing experience
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please
      feel free to reach out.
